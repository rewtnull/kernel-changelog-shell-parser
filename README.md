NAME

	kcp - kernel.org changelog shell parser

VERSION

	0.5

SYNOPSIS:

	kcp.sh [-h|--help] [-v|--version] <-k|--kernel <version>> [int|hash]

DESCRIPTION

	This script displays kernel changelogs from
	https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v*.x/ in shell.

	bash and (fully POSIX compatible) sh versions available.

	- By default it displays the entire changelog for the selected
	  kernel version
	- If an integer is entered at the end of the script arguments,
	  it displays commit # (in order of appearance in changelog)
	- If a hash is entered at the end of the script arguments,
	  it displays a commit by hash

	For unknown reasons, only minor updates (x.x.x) have a changelog on
	kernel.org. Thus even though this script supports the format, major
	(x.x) releases will return a 404. Example: At the time this script is
	written, the latest major version is 4.14, which lacks a changelog.
	However, the minor update 4.14.1 has a changelog available.

ARGUMENTS

	-h, --help			Display this help
	-v, --version			Display version and exit

	OPTIONS

	-k, --kernel <version>	Kernel version in format
					<1-9>[1-9].<1-9>[1-9][.<1-9>[1-9]]
	int				Commit# (in order of appearance)
	hash				Commit hash

	Required option is --kernel, and optionally an integer or a hash

	Note: The POSIX compatible version only supports the short options.

DEPENDENCIES

	You need to be root to run this script

	- curl
	- awk

	Additionally, depending on the script version you will need:

	    Bash version

	    - bash v4.2 or newer for the ordinary version
	    - getopt from util-linux

	    POSIX compatible version

	    - sh

	kcp.sh has built in sanity checks and will exit if any of these
	conditions are not met.

CONFIGURATION

	None, as of now
