NAME

	kcp - kernel.org changelog shell parser

VERSION

	0.3

SYNOPSIS:

	kcp.sh [-h|--help] [-v|--version] <-k|--kernel <version>> [int]

DESCRIPTION

	This script displays kernel changelogs from
	https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v*.x/ in shell.

	For unknown reasons, only minor updates (x.x.x) have a changelog on
	kernel.org. Thus even though this script supports the format, major
	(x.x) releases will return a 404. Example: At the time this script is
	written, the latest major version is 4.14, which lacks a changelog.
	However, when the minor 4.14.1 update is released there will be a
	changelog for it available.

	- By default it displays the entire changelog for the selected
	  kernel version
	- Optionally displays commit# (in order of appearance in changelog)
	  if an integer is entered at the end of the script arguments.

ARGUMENTS

	-h, --help			Display this help
	-v, --version			Display version and exit

	OPTIONS

	-k, --kernel <version>	Kernel version in format
					<1-9>[1-9].<1-9>[1-9][.<1-9>[1-9]]
	int				Commit# (in order of appearance)

	Required option is --kernel, and optionally an integer

DEPENDENCIES

	You need to be root to run this script

	- bash v4.2 or newer
	- curl
	- awk
	- getopt from util-linux

	kcp.sh has built in sanity checks and will exit if any of these
	conditions are not met.
